Connect the vcc pin to the 5V output pin, with a 100 ohm resistor to prevent overheating (at least thats what worked for me)
Use the init() function to specifiy which GPIO ports will be assigned to the pinout. 
use the config() function before doing anything with the screen
config() can also be used to configure the display later
read the comments for parameter details
