Connect the vcc pin to the 5V output pin
place a 100 ohm resistor between the GND pin and the ground connection to prevent overheating (at least thats what worked for me)
Use the assign_pins() function to specifiy which GPIO ports will be assigned to the pinout. 
use the config() function before doing anything with the screen (no arguments required)
config() can also be used to configure the display later
pass an 8x8 bool array into image_out() to display an image
rotate(your_image, n) rotates your_image counterclockwise n times
