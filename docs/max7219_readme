Connect the vcc pin to the raspberry pi's 5V output pin, with a 100 ohm resistor to prevent overheating (at least thats what worked for me)
Use the variables din, clk, cs to specifiy which GPIO ports will be assigned to the pinout. 
use the init() function before doing anything with the screen
init() can also be used to configure the display later
